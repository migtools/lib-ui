# useFormState

A custom hook for managing field values, validation, and other form state.
This is a simpler alternative to libraries like [Formik](https://formik.org/), built to minimize boilerplate and maximimize readability.
It includes full support for [TypeScript generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html); the types of values and function
parameters returned by `useFormField` and `useFormState` can be inferred from the `initialValue` passed to each `useFormField()`, or explicitly
passed as individual type parameters to each `useFormField<T>()`, or passed as a unified interface to the type parameter of `useFormState<T>()`.

This hook uses [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for field validation, and its TypeScript signature enforces that each of your schema types is
compatible with its field type. `yup` is bundled as a dependency of `@migtools/lib-ui`.

We built this solution because we find that most forms do not have complex requirements, and libraries like Formik and co. tend to add unnecessary complexity.
We were burned by lots of confusing debugging sessions trying to figure out the reinitialization behavior of Formik, among other things,
and decided that it would be better to use something much simpler which we have total control of in-house. We have found that we can build forms
more quickly and with fewer headaches this way, and we hope others find it useful as well.

Note: this package also provides a [ValidatedTextInput component](./?path=/docs/components-validatedtextinput--pattern-fly-text-fields) to simplify rendering
PatternFly text fields driven by this hook.

## Types

```ts
function useFormField<T>(
  initialValue: T,
  schema: [T] extends [Array<infer E>] ? yup.ArraySchema<E> : yup.Schema<T>,
  options: {
    initialTouched?: boolean; // Start field with isTouched set to true
    onChange?: (newValue: T) => void; // Called after any call to field.setValue, for side effects
  } = {}
): IFormField<T>;

function useFormState<TFieldValues>(
  fields: {
    // an object with values as useFormField calls
    [key in keyof TFieldValues]: IFormField<TFieldValues[key]>;
  },
  options: {
    revalidateOnChange?: unknown[];
    yupOptions?: ValidateOptions;
  } = {}
): IFormState<TFieldValues>;

interface IFormField<T> {
  value: T;
  setValue: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<T>>;
  defaultValue: T;
  cleanValue: T;
  reinitialize: (value: T) => void; // Sets defaultValue, cleanValue and current value. Value will be restored on revert or clear. Useful if initial values are loaded asynchronously.
  prefill: (value: T) => void; // Sets cleanValue and current value. Value will be restored on revert but not clear. Useful if values to be edited are loaded asynchronously but retains separate defaultValue for clear.
  markSaved: () => void; // Sets cleanValue to current value. Current value will be restored on revert but not clear. Useful if values have been saved to storage but the form is still open.
  clear: () => void; // Sets current value to defaultValue.
  revert: () => void; // Sets current value to cleanValue.
  isDirty: boolean; // True if current value is different from cleanValue.
  isTouched: boolean;
  setIsTouched: (isTouched: boolean) => void;
  schema: yup.AnySchema<T>;
}

interface IValidatedFormField<T> extends IFormField<T> {
  error: yup.ValidationError | null;
  isValid: boolean;
  shouldShowError: boolean; // True if field has validation errors and has been touched (false if it's just blank and untouched)
}

interface IFormState<TFieldValues> {
  fields: ValidatedFormFields<TFieldValues>;
  values: TFieldValues; // For convenience in submitting forms (values are also included in fields property)
  isDirty: boolean;
  isTouched: boolean;
  isValid: boolean;
  setValues: (newValues: Partial<TFieldValues>) => void; // Sets multiple values at once.
  reinitialize: (newValues: Partial<TFieldValues>) => void; // Reinitializes multiple values at once (see IFormField<T>)
  prefill: (newValues: Partial<TFieldValues>) => void; // Prefills multiple values at once (see IFormField<T>)
  markSaved: () => void; // Marks all fields as clean/saved (see IFormField<T>)
  clear: () => void; // Clears all fields (see IFormField<T>)
  revert: () => void; // Reverts all fields (see IFormField<T>)
}
```

## Examples

### Basic text fields

In this example, the Name field is required and has a required length of 4 to 64 characters.
The Description field is optional, but has a maximum length of 128 characters.
When values matching these validation schema are entered, the Submit button will enable.
When invalid values are entered, a descriptive error will appear on the field when it loses focus.

Note: This example is given to demonstrate how custom fields with any markup can be built using this hook.
The below examples show how to use it with PatternFly components.

### PatternFly text fields with explicit props

This form is the same as the above example, except using PatternFly's TextInput and TextArea instead of plain HTML elements.

Note: This example is given to demonstrate how custom PatternFly fields can be built using this hook.
The below example shows how to render these fields even more simply using helper components.

  <Story story={PatternFlyTextFields} />

### PatternFly text fields with prop helpers

This package also provides `getTextInputProps` and `getTextAreaProps` helpers which can take a form field object
and return the necessary props to render PatternFly's FormGroup, TextInput and TextArea components.

Note: These helpers are provided for convenience if you need to build a custom field, you can reduce boilerplate even further by
using the [ValidatedTextInput component](./?path=/docs/components-validatedtextinput--pattern-fly-text-fields).

Most custom non-text fields can use `getFormGroupProps` even if the other helpers are not useful.

### Complex field types and validations

You can store any type of value in a form field, but you need to find the right `yup` schema type to use. `yup.string()`, `yup.number()` and `yup.boolean()` are straightforward,
but you may also need to use things like `yup.array()`, `yup.date()`, `yup.object<ObjectSchema>()`. (Note: only use `yup.object` when you need specific validation on each property in the object, which may be better designed as individual useFormField hooks).
If nothing else fits, you can always use `yup.mixed<T>()` which allows you to use any type but does not validate the value for you. If you use `mixed`, be sure to add your own validations with schema methods like `required`, `oneOf`, and `test`.
See the [yup API documentation](https://github.com/jquense/yup#api) for more information.

This example includes a mixed field and an array field (leveraging the `useSelectionState` hook also provided by lib-ui). It has custom validations to make sure the store you select is open and that you don't select more than 2 items (for some reason).

Note that the type parameters passed here to `useFormField` are not required, because the field type can usually be inferred from the yup schema.
However, since the schema are non-trivial we're specifying types here explicitly just to be sure the schema match up with what we're expecting.
If you're having trouble with yup schema types resolving to `T | undefined` instead of `T`, try chaining `.default(someDefault)` to tell yup what to validate against if there is an undefined value.

### Pre-filling a form asynchronously

If the form's initial values are known when it is first rendered, they can simply be passed as the `initialValue` arguments of each `useFormField` call.
However, let's say you're using a form to edit some object you're loading from the network and you need to wait for that request to resolve before you pre-fill the form.

For this, you can use the `prefill` function on each field object. This changes the current field value, but it also changes the `cleanValue` (used to determine if the form `isDirty` and used when `revert`ing the form).

Here, the submit button is only enabled if the form is dirty, so you can clearly see whether changes have been made to the object from the network that we're editing.
The revert button also changes the values back to the values we got from the network instead of clearing the form.

Note that we have separate buttons here for "Revert" and "Clear". The `revert` function sets each field to its `cleanValue` (which can be changed by `prefill`), and the `clear` function sets each
field to its `defaultValue` (which can be changed by `reinitialize`). Both default to the `initialValue` originally passed into `useFormField`.

This distinction between clean/prefilled and default/initialized values is useful in cases like this where we only want to enable the submit button if the values have been changed compared to
our real server-side data, but we also want to provide a way to clear the form back to a truly empty state.

## TODO: doc improvements

These hooks are still in development as we use them in products and discover issues and features we need.

TODO:

- More examples with different types of fields, custom field types, etc.
- Better explanation of inferred types and variations with explicit type params used
- Unit tests
- Possible performance optimizations
- ???
