# useSelectionState

A custom hook for managing a subset of an array which represents the user's current selection of items in that array.
Can be used for a set of selected checkboxes, a set of expanded rows in an expandable table, and more.

Supports passing a TypeScript type for the array items using [generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html).

<!-- Not sure if there is a way to pull in this signature from the source automatically, that'd be better -->

```ts
// Syntax:
const selectionState = useSelectionState<T>(args: ISelectionStateArgs<T>);

// Arguments:
interface ISelectionStateArgs<T> {
  items: T[];
  initialSelected?: T[]; // Defaults to []
  isEqual?: (a: T, b: T) => boolean; // Defaults to (a, b) => a === b
  externalState?: [T[], React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<T[]>>];
}

// Return value:
interface ISelectionState<T> {
  selectedItems: T[];
  isItemSelected: (item: T) => boolean;
  toggleItemSelected: (item: T, isSelecting?: boolean) => void;
  selectMultiple: (items: T[], isSelecting: boolean) => void;
  areAllSelected: boolean;
  selectAll: (isSelecting?: boolean) => void;
  setSelectedItems: (items: T[]) => void;
}
```

The hook keeps references to your actual item objects instead of an id or key in its state, so that the
resulting `selectedItems` array contains all relevant context for use in e.g. form submission.
It returns state and functions you can use to inspect and update the selections.

## Rendering the selected state

In your component, you can use `isItemSelected(item)` when rendering the selected state of an item.
`isItemSelected` uses the hook's `isEqual` argument to compare the given item with the selected items.
By default, this uses referential equality (`===`), which works great if you're working with immutable data.

However, **if your item objects can change between renders, you need to specify an alternate implementation of the `isEqual` argument.**
For example, if your items have `id` properties, you can use `isEqual: (a, b) => a.id === b.id`.

## Lifting state to an external scope

If necessary, you can pass the optional `externalState` prop in order to manage the actual selections array itself from outside the hook.
This may be useful if you need to manage the state as part of a centralized form, but you still want the logic from these methods.
The type of `externalState` is the same as the array returned from `React.useState` (a tuple of `value` and `setValue`.)

## Examples

### Checkboxes

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Checkboxes} />
</Canvas>

### Expandable table

<Canvas>
  <Story story={ExpandableTable} />
</Canvas>

### Checkboxes with external state

<Canvas>
  <Story story={ExternalState} />
</Canvas>
