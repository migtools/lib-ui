# useSessionStorage

A custom hook resembling `React.useState` which persists any JSON-serializable value using the
browser's [sessionStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage).

See also: [useLocalStorage](/docs/hooks-uselocalstorage--persistent-counter-example)

The value identified by a unique `key` will persist across page reloads and component unmounts/remounts.
Unlike `useLocalStorage` however, the value will be cleared if the tab or window is closed and it will not be shared
between multiple tabs.
See the [sessionStorage API docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) for more
details on when data stored in sessionStorage expires.

Just like `useState`, `useSessionStorage` returns the current value and setter function in an array tuple so they can be
given arbitrary names using [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment),
and it supports TypeScript [generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) and can optionally
infer its return types based on the `defaultValue`.

```ts
const [value, setValue] = useSessionStorage<T>({ key: string, defaultValue: T });
```

## Notes

On first render, `value` will either be synchronously loaded from storage or will fall back to `defaultValue` if there
is no value in storage. If necessary, the data can be fully removed from `sessionStorage` by calling
`setValue(undefined)`, which will re-render with `value` set back to `defaultValue`. Note that this is distinct from
calling `setValue(null)`, which will persist the `null` value.

If `setValue` is called with a value which cannot be serialized to JSON
([see Exceptions here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#exceptions)),
or if an error is thrown by the `sessionStorage` API, the error is caught and logged to the console and the `value` falls
back to the `defaultValue`.

`useSessionStorage` is safe to use in a server-side rendering or unit testing environment where `window.sessionStorage` is
not available. If `window` is undefined, the hook will simply act like a normal `useState` (only update the value cached
in React state).

## Examples

For each of these examples, try changing the value and reloading the page to see the persistence in action, and try
opening this page in multiple windows side-by-side to see that the values are unique to each browser tab.

### Persistent counter (`number` value)

The classic `useState` example, but persistent. The `count` variable's type here is inferred as a primitive `number`,
not a `string`.

### Persistent text field (`string` value)

### Persistent array and object values

Any JSON-serializable value can be used with `useSessionStorage` such as an array or an object. Note that this may not be
desirable; if possible it is simpler to use multiple instances of `useSessionStorage` with separate keys and individual primitive values.
